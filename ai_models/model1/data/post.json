    "draft_text": "The global consulting and auditing industry is valued at nearly $240 billion, dominated by international networks and global strategy majors. Despite India's world-class talent pool, domestic firms remain marginal players, particularly in high-value audits and consulting, partly due to structural and regulatory barriers. The government has taken steps to strengthen Indian firms, including the RBI circular on statutory audits and a focus on 'Make in India' for professional services. A significant asymmetry exists between Indian firms and their global competitors. International firms operate as multidisciplinary networks, offering a wide range of services and leveraging global brands. Indian firms are often smaller, more fragmented, and restricted by regulations that limit their ability to form similar multidisciplinary structures. Several issues hinder the growth of Indian firms, including: (i) An advertising and marketing ban for professionals, (ii-iii) Restrictions on multidisciplinary partnerships (MDPs) and fragmented licensing by different regulators, (iv) Unfair public procurement processes that favor global firms, and (v) A lack of global collaboration platforms for Indian firms. Q1. Suggest specific changes in the Rules/Regulations administering different professionals in India to ensure Indian firms develop into globally competitive players in the field of consultancy. Q2. Suggest successful models of multidisciplinary and large professional service firms, which can be adapted in the Indian context. Q8. Suggest strategies that can be adopted by Indian professional service firms for building their brands globally."
