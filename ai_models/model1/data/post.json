The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) is committed to fostering a business environment that enables Indian companies and firms to grow, scale, and compete on a global level. This background note invites comments and suggestions on a proposal to facilitate the establishment of Multi-Disciplinary Partnership (MDP) firms to strengthen India's economic sovereignty and achieve the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat in the professional services sector. 1. Introduction The global consulting and auditing industry is valued at nearly $240 billion, dominated by international networks and global strategy majors. Despite India's world-class talent pool, domestic firms remain marginal players, particularly in high-value audits and consulting, partly due to structural and regulatory barriers. The government has taken steps to strengthen Indian firms, including the RBI circular on statutory audits and a focus on 'Make in India' for professional services. This note explores the next phase of reforms to enable the creation of large, Indian-owned professional service firms. 2. Current Asymmetry A significant asymmetry exists between Indian firms and their global competitors. International firms operate as multidisciplinary networks, offering a wide range of services (audit, consulting, legal, technology) and leveraging global brands. Indian firms are often smaller, more fragmented, and restricted by regulations that limit their ability to form similar multidisciplinary structures. 3. Earlier attempts at allowing MDPs There have been earlier attempts to allow MDPs in India. The Companies Act, 2013, and the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008, contain provisions that could potentially facilitate such structures. However, these have not been fully realized due to the regulations of various professional bodies that govern their members. 4. Issues which need to be addressed to help grow Indian firms to International level Several issues hinder the growth of Indian firms, including: i. Advertising and Marketing ban: Professionals such as chartered accountants, company secretaries, and lawyers face restrictions on advertising and branding due to regulations set by their governing bodies. This ban limits Indian firms from building strong brands. ii. Restrictions on multidisciplinary partnerships (MDPs): Professionals from different fields are not allowed to form a single partnership firm, preventing them from offering integrated, \"one-stop\" services. iii. Fragmented licensing by different regulators: Each profession is governed by a different regulator (ICAI, ICSI, etc.), creating silos and limiting collaboration. iv. Unfair public procurement processes: Government tenders often have eligibility criteria (like global turnover) that automatically favor large foreign firms over capable Indian ones. v. Lack of global collaboration platforms: There is a need for platforms that enable Indian firms to collaborate and compete for international projects. Questionnaire To formulate a comprehensive policy, the Ministry invites suggestions on the following questions: Q1. Suggest specific changes in the Rules/Regulations administering different professionals in India to ensure Indian firms develop into globally competitive players in the field of consultancy. Q2. Suggest successful models of multidisciplinary and large professional service firms, which can be adapted in the Indian context. Q3. What are the specific challenges faced by Indian professional service firms in building their brands? Q4. Suggest a comparative analysis of the regulatory frameworks for professional service firms in other jurisdictions (e.g., UK, USA, Singapore). Q5. What measures can be taken to promote a level playing field between Indian and international firms in public procurement? Q6. How can technology be leveraged to create a collaboration platform for Indian firms? Q7. What are the potential risks of allowing MDPs, and how can they be mitigated? Q8. Suggest strategies that can be adopted by Indian professional service firms for building their brands globally. Q9. Any other suggestions to strengthen the Indian professional services sector. Comments and suggestions, along with a brief justification, may be submitted to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs by the close of business hours on 30.09.2025. (Signature) (Deputy Director, Ministry of Corporate Affairs)"
