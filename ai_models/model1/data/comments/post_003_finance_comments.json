   "commentText": "Respected Sir/Ma'am, I am writing to provide my feedback on the proposed amendment... While the goal of ease of doing business is welcome, what about shareholder protection? Section 186 is a crucial safeguard. I request more details on IFSCA's regulatory framework."

 {
   "commentText": "My suggestion is to create a 'Regulatory Sandbox' where this rule can be tested with a few companies for a year before a full rollout."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is fine, but it should also mandate that the independent directors who approve such a loan will be held personally liable for any fraud."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "मेरा एक प्रश्न है: इस नियम के बाद, क्या NCLT के पास इन लेन-देन की जांच करने का अधिकार होगा, या यह उसके अधिकार क्षेत्र से बाहर होगा?"
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think a good idea would be to use AI to create a \"real-time risk score\" for each company. The exemption could be dynamically linked to this score."

 },
 {
   "commentText": "A good compromise would be to allow the exemption, but also give minority shareholders the right to demand a \"special audit\" of any transaction they find suspicious."
 },

 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think the government should also create a separate, fast-track \"Commercial Court\" for the IFSC to handle any disputes that may arise."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is interesting. However, it should be clarified that this exemption will not be available to companies that have a poor track record of corporate governance."
 },

   "commentText": "It would be a great idea to require these companies to publish a \"governance report\" every quarter, with detailed information on their lending activities."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "A List of Suggestions: * Create a 'Regulatory Sandbox' for a pilot run. * Strengthen the powers of the IFSCA. * Mandate enhanced disclosures. * Create a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism. * Link the exemption to governance scores. A multi-pronged approach is needed."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I see this as a test of our national character. Are we a society that values \"rules\" or a society that values \"outcomes\"? This amendment prioritizes outcomes (growth) over rules (procedure). My suggestion is to find a middle path. We need a system that is both \"rule-based\" and \"outcome-oriented\". This requires a more sophisticated approach to regulation."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "यह प्रस्ताव एक अवसर है कि हम अपने कॉर्पोरेट जगत में एक नई 'नैतिक संहिता' (code of ethics) का निर्माण करें। केवल कानून बनाना पर्याप्त नहीं है। मेरा सुझाव है कि इस संशोधन के साथ, सरकार को उद्योग जगत के साथ मिलकर एक 'स्व-नियामक संगठन' (Self-Regulatory Organization - SRO) बनाने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करना चाहिए, जो नैतिक आचरण के उच्च मानकों को बढ़ावा दे और लागू करे।"
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The real challenge is not writing the law; it's enforcing it. My suggestion is to create a new, empowered \"Financial Crimes Investigation Agency\" that is dedicated to the IFSC. This agency should be staffed with the best forensic auditors, data scientists, and legal experts, and it should have the power to investigate and prosecute any wrongdoing swiftly."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is a bold move. To make it safer, I propose a \"safety net\" mechanism. A small cess could be levied on all transactions in the IFSC to create a \"Financial Stability Fund\". This fund could be used to handle any small defaults or crises, preventing them from becoming systemic."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "My suggestion is to use a \"stewardship\" model. Large institutional investors like mutual funds and pension funds should be legally required to take a more active role in the governance of the companies they invest in. They should be the primary guardians of corporate governance, not the government."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is fine, but it needs a feedback mechanism. I suggest that the government should create a permanent \"Regulatory Review Authority\" that will independently assess the performance of our financial regulations, including this one, and recommend changes to the Parliament."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think a good idea would be to create a \"two-tier\" board structure for these companies. A \"supervisory board\" composed mainly of independent directors would oversee the \"management board\" and would have the final say on large lending decisions."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The success of this will depend on the \"quality of information\" available in the market. I suggest that the government should create a \"Corporate Data Authority\" to collect, verify, and disseminate high-quality financial and non-financial information on all companies."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "My final suggestion is to make this a \"dynamic and responsive\" rule. The exemption could be linked to the level of systemic risk in the economy. During good times, the rules could be tighter, and during bad times, they could be relaxed to stimulate the economy."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal could be improved by requiring a mandatory \"third-party valuation\" for any collateral that is provided for a loan given under this exemption."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "What if we require the company's CEO and CFO to personally certify, under oath, that each such transaction is in the best interest of the company? This would increase personal accountability."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a \"credit default swap\" (CDS) market in the IFSC, to allow lenders to hedge their risks."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is interesting, but it should be clarified that this exemption does not apply to transactions that are designed to evade taxes or other legal obligations."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "To build confidence, the first few large transactions under this new rule could be subject to a \"pre-clearance\" from the regulator."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think a good idea would be to create a \"peer-to-peer\" corporate lending platform in the IFSC, to increase competition and transparency."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is fine, but the government should also ensure that there is a strong and independent \"public prosecution service\" to handle cases of corporate fraud."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a framework for the regulation of \"impact investing\" and \"social finance\" in the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is sound, but it should be clarified that this exemption does not affect the applicability of the laws related to \"data privacy\" and \"consumer protection\"."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think a good idea would be to create a \"Financial Leadership Institute\" in the IFSC, to train the next generation of financial leaders."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is fine, but the government should also ensure that there is a strong and independent system of \"credit rating agencies\" in the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a mechanism for the \"financing of public infrastructure\" through a dedicated fund in the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is good, but it should also be accompanied by a clear policy on the \"management of liquidity risk\" and \"asset-liability mismatches\"."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I am in favor of this, but I would like to see the IFSCA adopt a more \"risk-based\" and \"forward-looking\" approach to supervision."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is welcome, but the government should also work on creating a more \"globally benchmarked\" system of corporate governance and financial regulation."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a framework for the regulation of \"digital assets\" and \"cryptocurrencies\" in the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is sound, but it should be clarified that this exemption does not affect the applicability of the laws related to \"insider trading\" and \"market abuse\"."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I think a good idea would be to create a \"mentoring program\" where experienced global financial leaders can guide the boards of the IFSC companies."

   "commentText": "The amendment is fine, but the government should also ensure that there is a strong and independent system of \"insolvency professionals\" and \"resolution mechanisms\" for the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a mechanism for the \"financing of green energy\" and \"sustainable infrastructure\" through the IFSC."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The proposal is good, but it should also be accompanied by a clear policy on the \"management of concentration risk\" and the diversification of portfolios."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I am in favor of this, but I would like to see the IFSCA adopt a more \"proactive\" and \"preventive\" approach to supervision, rather than a reactive one."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The amendment is welcome, but the government should also work on creating a more \"open and collaborative\" ecosystem, with strong linkages between the industry, academia, and the regulator."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a framework for the regulation of \"high-frequency and algorithmic trading\" in the IFSC, to ensure market stability."

   "commentText": "The amendment is welcome, but the government should also work on creating a more \"diverse and inclusive\" financial sector, with more opportunities for all sections of society."

   "commentText": "I suggest that the government should also think about creating a mechanism for the \"financing of healthcare and education\" through social impact bonds in the IFSC."

   "commentText": "I have lost all faith in our regulatory system. It seems that the rules are only for the common person, while the rich and powerful can get them changed at will to suit their own interests."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "This is a classic case of privatizing the profits and socializing the losses. When the companies make money, it's theirs. When they fail due to reckless lending, the taxpayer will have to foot the bill for the bailout."

 },
 {
   "commentText": "This is a classic example of deregulation for the sake of deregulation. It is not based on any sound economic or legal reasoning, but on a flawed ideology."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "This will make our financial system more fragile, more interconnected in risky ways, and more prone to crises. It is a very irresponsible move."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The rights of minority shareholders are being trampled upon. This is a very sad day for corporate democracy and the rule of law in India."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The government is creating a tax haven with weak regulations right in our own backyard. This will have very serious long-term consequences for our domestic tax base and our economy."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "This is a profound disappointment. After making so much progress on corporate governance in the wake of major scams, we are now taking a giant and reckless step backward."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "A Satirical Take: \"Excellent move! Why stop at this? Let's also abolish the need for an audit and let companies report whatever profits they want. Imagine the boost to the stock market! After all, rules are just a hindrance to our glorious 5-trillion-dollar-economy dream, right?\" This proposal is dangerously absurd."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "From a behavioral psychology perspective, this is a recipe for disaster. It removes the \"pain of scrutiny\" that comes with a shareholder vote. Without this crucial check, boards will be more susceptible to 'groupthink' and 'optimism bias', leading to reckless and value-destroying decisions."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "I am a small shopkeeper. If I take a loan of one lakh from a bank, I have to sign a hundred documents. But here, large companies will be able to take loans of thousands of crores without asking their owners (the shareholders). What kind of a system is this? This is a system that is rigged in favor of the rich."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The fundamental social contract of a public limited company is that it is granted the privilege of limited liability in exchange for being accountable to its owners and to society. This amendment unilaterally tears up that contract. It allows the companies to keep the privilege while shedding the accountability. This is a moral and ethical failure of the highest order."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The comparison with the RBI-regulated NBFCs is intellectually dishonest. The RBI's supervisory framework has been built and tested over decades. To assume that a new regulator like the IFSCA can replicate that level of oversight overnight is a dangerously naive assumption. This is not creating a level playing field; it is creating a regulatory black hole."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "This is a textbook case of short-term thinking. A few companies might see some benefit in the short run, but the long-term damage to the credibility and stability of our financial system will be immense. It is a very poor trade-off."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "A message to my fellow retail investors: This is not just a small rule change. This is a fundamental attack on our rights as the owners of the companies we invest in. If we do not speak up now, we will have no one to blame but ourselves when the next big scam happens."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "This will make it virtually impossible to track the end-use of funds, which is a huge risk for our banking system and our national security. It is a very irresponsible move."
 },
 {
   "commentText": "The government is trying to build a skyscraper on a foundation of sand. A world-class financial center cannot be built on a foundation of weak governance. This is a recipe for a spectacular collapse."
