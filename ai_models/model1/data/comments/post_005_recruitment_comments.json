  "commentText": "This draft is an excellent step towards improving the functioning of the Official Liquidator’s office. It provides a structured framework that ensures accountability and transparency. The inclusion of terms and conditions with a clear selection process is commendable. By opening opportunities for advocates and associates, it gives professionals a platform to contribute their skills effectively. The remuneration is reasonable for a temporary post, and the responsibilities are clearly outlined, which makes it easier for candidates to evaluate whether they are suitable for the role. Overall, this initiative will improve efficiency and enhance confidence in the system."
 },
 {
  "commentText": "This draft, while aiming to create opportunities, falls short in addressing practical concerns. The remuneration of Rs.50,000 per month might not be attractive enough for professionals with more experience. Additionally, the draft does not address how performance will be measured objectively, leaving room for bias in selection and termination. The workload described seems high for a temporary role without sufficient long-term security. Without more clarity on job stability and fair evaluation, this draft may fail to attract the best talent."
 },
 {
  "commentText": "The draft appears balanced in presenting the scope of work and responsibilities, but it could benefit from more specific timelines and measurable outcomes. While the remuneration is fixed and transparent, the draft does not clarify if there will be scope for renewal or extension after 12 months. The selection process is well-outlined, but it remains to be seen how effectively it is implemented. Overall, the draft lays a foundation but could use more depth."

  "commentText": "यह ड्राफ्ट ऑफिसियल लिक्विडेटर के ऑफिस की कार्यप्रणाली को और बेहतर बनाने की दिशा में बहुत अच्छा कदम है। इसमें टर्म्स और कंडीशन्स स्पष्ट रूप से लिखे गए हैं, जिससे transparency और accountability दोनों बढ़ेंगी। एडवोकेट्स और एसोसिएट्स को मौका देकर यह युवाओं और प्रोफेशनल्स के लिए भी एक शानदार अवसर है। रेम्यूनरेशन भी ठीक है और जिम्मेदारियाँ साफ-साफ लिखी गई हैं। इस तरह की पॉलिसी सिस्टम में भरोसा बढ़ाती है।"
 },
 {
  "commentText": "यह ड्राफ्ट अच्छे इरादों से बनाया गया है लेकिन इसमें कई practical समस्याएँ हैं। 50,000 रुपये प्रति माह का पारिश्रमिक अनुभवी प्रोफेशनल्स के लिए कम हो सकता है। इसके अलावा, performance को कैसे मापा जाएगा इसपर कोई स्पष्टता नहीं है। काम का बोझ काफी ज्यादा है लेकिन नौकरी की स्थिरता नहीं दी गई है। ऐसे में अच्छे और अनुभवी उम्मीदवार शायद इस अवसर में रुचि न लें।"
 },
 {
  "commentText": "यह ड्राफ्ट सामान्य रूप से ठीक है और इसमें काम और जिम्मेदारियों का विवरण दिया गया है। हालांकि इसमें कुछ समयसीमा और measurable outcomes की कमी है। 12 महीने की अवधि के बाद आगे क्या होगा इसपर कोई स्पष्टता नहीं है। चयन प्रक्रिया लिखी गई है लेकिन उसका implementation देखना होगा। कुल मिलाकर यह एक शुरुआत है लेकिन और गहराई होनी चाहिए।"
 },
 {
  "commentText": "Draft mein kuch major issues hain jaise ki remuneration jo zyada experienced logon ke liye attractive nahi hai. Performance evaluation ke liye proper mechanism mention nahi kiya gaya. Workload kaafi heavy lag raha hai aur long-term security nahi hai. Yeh sab cheeze draft ko weak banati hain."
 },
 {

 },
 {
  "commentText": "Draft overall thik lagta hai. Roles aur responsibilities mentioned hain lekin timelines aur measurable outcomes ki kami hai. Renewal ka option mention nahi hai. Selection process likha hai par implementation dekhna hoga. Neutral draft hai jo ek base banata hai."
